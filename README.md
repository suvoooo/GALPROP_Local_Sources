# GALPROP_Local_Sources
## These files are usually found under the source directory in GALPROP. 
 
The source code (several files) is modified to take into account of nearby CR sources around the solar system. Here only SNR (electron-only) and pulsars (electron-positron pair) are considered, later we added check about proton source to study hadronic injection from the galactic center.

# GALPROP_Local_Sources
## these files are usually found under the source directory in GALPROP. 
### The source code (several files) is modified to take into account of nearby CR sources around the solar system. 
#### here only SNR (electron-only) and pulsars (electron-positron pair) are considered, later we will check about proton source 
to study hadronic injection from the galactic center.
